"Hi I am Mammu from USA creating this piece of code"

"I think I suck at coding"

"Hi I am Moni from Mumbai creating this piece of code"

"I think I am better at coding"

"Hi Mammu again from USA this is to be coded in Java"

"Please use java libraries"
Crazy I don't understand Java but I know Python
